**about doublespeak.**   
DoubleSpeak is the University of Pennsylvania’s only journal for literary translation and the only literary translation journal in the country run by undergraduate students. Founded over a decade ago, our annual (print and online) journal celebrates a range of languages and cultures through thoughtful curation of poets across centuries and around the world. We publish translations of poems both little-known and internationally beloved, from a profound variety of languages and dialects. Along with the original on the facing page, each translation is accompanied by a biographical note about the poet and a substantial “translator’s note,” in which the contributor reflects on particular challenges of the translation process.

Thank you to the Kelly Writers House, the Student Activities Council at the University of Pennsylvania, and the Price Lab for Digital Humanities, especially Cassandra Hradil, for their support of DoubleSpeak. This site was created by Quinn Gruber, Alisha Kumar, Cassandra Hradil, and Mia Kim.
